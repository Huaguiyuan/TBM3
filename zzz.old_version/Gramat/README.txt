GraMat (Graphic Card Matrix Interface) is a library that
I developed during my Ph.D study. This library can help
boost the use of the GPU based MAGMA library which solve
linear algebra equations.
GraMat integrate single, double, single-complex and double-
complex floating variable and provide a unified interface
for the basic matrix operation.
Up to now, the most important operations are:
1. Matrix multiplication,
2. Eigenvalue decomposition (matrix diagonalization).

GraMat relies on the MAGMA GPU library, and you can easily find the
instructions from : http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/

I will further publish a document for the detailed instructions.
However, up to now, you can refernce the "main_example.cpp" to get a hands on.
